**Program Description**

This program is a Flask-based web application that allows users to input a URL and receive a prediction on its status. The app uses a pre-trained Random Forest model to classify URLs into one of several categories: SAFE, MALICIOUS, or UNKNOWN. 

When a user enters a URL and submits it, the application extracts key features from the URL, runs these features through the model, and displays the prediction result on the webpage. This tool provides an easy way for users to check the safety and legitimacy of URLs through a simple web interface.
